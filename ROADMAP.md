# Roadmap 
The order of this list may not reflect the order in which those functionalities will be implemented  
  
- adding the wallet balance in the side menu
- drive storage for synchronisation (http://remotestoragejs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- wallet translation in multiple languages (will include date and number format)
- wasm to improve speed
- receive page: add payment id support
- receive page: add mempool check (only when payment id) & progression
- offline payment made easier
- p2p connection between a computer and another device(phone, ...) for a sync method (to reduce the heat on small devices)
- and in the "long term" (3/6 month) it will connect directly on a masarid ! (i will work with the others (thaer, crypto) to improve the rpc so allow it)
- improve tx fee calculation
- detect when multiple tabs are open to prevent data collision
- continue to scan while the page is not focused
- support https://github.com/monero-project/monero/wiki/URI-Formatting
- transactions export in CSV
- api to obtain a custom url
